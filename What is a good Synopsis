What is a good Synopsis?

A good synopsis is Chapter 1 (Introduction), Chapter 2 (Literature Review) and Chapter 3 (Methodology-Partial).
A base paper should be implemented and results should be presented in the Synopsis Presentation. The same code converts into a Methodology Diagram.

Later after Synopsis, we refine the Methodology Diagram based on the modifications in the code.

Select a dataset which is publicly available and used in recent Quality Journals. 
Take help of ChatGPT but finally write it yourself. 
Take help in writing text but then rewrite it by yourself.
Take help in drawing a Methodology Diagram but later draw it yourself.

Turnitin is continuously updating their AI Similarity detection part. Today, maybe Turnitin can not detect the AI Similarity, but maybe after a month/year it will be able to detect and then you will be in trouble.

Better to show your paper to us (Supervisors) before submitting. Even before this stage, show us your Results and then start writing Results and Discussion Section.
