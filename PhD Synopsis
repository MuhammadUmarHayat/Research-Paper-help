PhD Synopsis

Title

Explainable and Trustworthy Multimodal AI for Clinical Decision Support in Medical Imaging and Radiology Reports

---

## 1. Introduction / Background

Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Deep Learning (DL), Computer Vision (CV), and Natural Language Processing (NLP), have significantly impacted the healthcare domain. Medical imaging modalities such as X-ray, CT, MRI, and PET generate large volumes of visual data, while radiology reports provide rich textual descriptions of clinical findings. Traditionally, these modalities are analyzed separately, leading to suboptimal clinical decision-making.

Multimodal AI, especially Vision-Language Models (VLMs), enables joint learning from medical images and associated text reports. However, despite high predictive performance, current systems often lack **explainability, transparency, and clinical trust**, limiting real-world adoption. This research aims to develop an **explainable, safe, and trustworthy multimodal AI framework** for disease diagnosis and clinical decision support in radiology.

## 2. Problem Statement

Existing multimodal AI models in healthcare:

* Act as black-box systems with limited interpretability
* Do not sufficiently address clinical safety, bias, and trust
* Provide weak alignment between visual evidence and textual explanations
* Lack robustness across diverse datasets and imaging modalities

There is a critical need for an **explainable multimodal AI system** that integrates medical images and radiology reports while providing clinically meaningful explanations and uncertainty-aware predictions.

## 3. Research Objectives

### General Objective

To design and evaluate an explainable and trustworthy multimodal AI framework for medical imaging-based clinical decision support.

### Specific Objectives

1. To develop a multimodal dataset combining medical images and radiology reports.
2. To design a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for joint image-text representation learning.
3. To integrate explainability techniques (visual and textual) into the model.
4. To incorporate uncertainty estimation and safety-aware mechanisms.
5. To evaluate the model across multiple diseases and imaging modalities.
6. To compare the proposed framework with state-of-the-art unimodal and multimodal models.

## 4. Research Questions

1. How can medical images and radiology reports be effectively fused for accurate diagnosis?
2. How can explainability be embedded into multimodal AI models for clinical trust?
3. What explainable outputs are most useful for radiologists and clinicians?
4. How does uncertainty-aware prediction improve patient safety?
5. Can the proposed model generalize across different datasets and diseases?

## 7. Literature Review (Summary)

Recent studies demonstrate the effectiveness of multimodal AI in healthcare; however:

* Most models prioritize accuracy over interpretability
